When your audience are at your festival or concert, they share a collective experience. They do not know each other, which only makes their relation relevant as long as your event takes place. With Gignal audience in- and outside your festival or concert, can follow the conversation created by fans across social networks.

Added value:

1. Traffic driver, by allowing people to follow and interact across social networks from your website or billboards.
2. Amplify your social media buzz, by sharing and spreading the messages and pictures made by the audience on Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and Flickr, collected by your chosen geotag and #tags.
3. Give your audience the opportunity to interact for as long as your event takes place.

### Testimonial: Roskilde Festival

> Gignal allowed Roskilde Festival to amplify the social experience, by capturing and presenting the real-time buzz created by our passionate audience. Gignal was presented on the front page of our website and on our stage billboards, visualizing content produced by the audience - authentic and real-time across social networks.

> Gignal allowed us to collect, host and own all the festival buzz and traffic from Facebook, Twitter, check-ins and pictures, made by the audience - for the audience.
