For conferences networking and knowledge is central. With Gignal conferences attendees can follow other peoples thoughts at the conference, and people outside can get insight and summaries from the speaks. People can see who else is attending from Gignals stream on physical screens and on the conference website, and they can communicate and connect - based on the shared experience and the interest in knowledge.

Added value:

1. Traffic driver, by allowing people to follow and interact across social networks from your website or on physical screens.
2. Amplify your social media buzz, by sharing and spreading the messages and pictures made by the audience on Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and Flickr, collected by your chosen geotag and #tags.
3. Give your audience the opportunity to interact for as long as your event takes place.
4. Take your conference knowledge viral - and amplify your event.
5. Support networking by presenting the voice and profiles of people attending.

## Testimonials


### TEDxCopenhagen

> Let the crowd create the buzz and use Gignal to show it to the world. It's an easy and powerful way to create a meta-universe with pictures, tweets and check-ins. 

*LÃ¦rke Ullerup, TEDxCopenhagen organizer*


### Startup Week 2011

from <a href="http://blog.gignal.com/post/11351458815/thanks-for-the-testimonial-startup-week-2011">the blog post</a>:

> Gignal + Startup Week was a perfect fit. Tons of pictures were uploaded during these 5 days, the audience tweeted like hell and thanks to Gignal, it was all collected and amplified from one place. It was a win for our participants, who saw at a glance what was going on, whether they were engaging from our main venue, at one of our side events or at home. And it was of course, also a win for us as organisers. We were always up to date with what was going on, saw potential problems mentioned by our audience in minutes, and stayed in contact with our participants. #sw11

### Danish Journalist Festival

> At the Danish Union of Journalists we were very happy to use the Gignal service at The Danish Media Conference in November 2010. Gignal offers a great overview on the social media activity present, and was a great and easy way to communicate what others communicate at our conference venue. A warm recommendation of Gignal to similar events, where social media plays an active role.
