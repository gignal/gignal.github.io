	claim has been infringed; a description of where the material that you claim is

	agreements between you and Gignal with respect to the Gignal Service. Choice of
	Law and Forum. The TOS and the relationship between you and Gignal shall be
	governed by the laws of Denmark without regard to its conflict of law
	provisions. Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Gignal to exercise
	or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of
	such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of
	competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
	court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
	the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and
	effect.
