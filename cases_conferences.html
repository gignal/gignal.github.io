  <h2>Case: Conferences</h2>

  <p>For conferences networking and knowledge is central. With Gignal conferences attendees can follow other peoples thoughts at the conference, and people outside can get insight and summaries from the speaks. People can see who else is attending from Gignals stream on physical screens and on the conference website, and they can communicate and connect - based on the shared experience and the interest in knowledge.</p>

<p>Let the crowd create the buzz and use Gignal to show it to the world. It&#39;s an easy and powerful way to create a meta-universe with pictures, tweets and check-ins. </p>

<p>from <a href="http://blog.gignal.com/post/11351458815/thanks-for-the-testimonial-startup-week-2011">the blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gignal + Startup Week was a perfect fit. Tons of pictures were uploaded during these 5 days, the audience tweeted like hell and thanks to Gignal, it was all collected and amplified from one place. It was a win for our participants, who saw at a glance what was going on, whether they were engaging from our main venue, at one of our side events or at home. And it was of course, also a win for us as organisers. We were always up to date with what was going on, saw potential problems mentioned by our audience in minutes, and stayed in contact with our participants. #sw11</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the Danish Union of Journalists we were very happy to use the Gignal service at The Danish Media Conference in November 2010. Gignal offers a great overview on the social media activity present, and was a great and easy way to communicate what others communicate at our conference venue. A warm recommendation of Gignal to similar events, where social media plays an active role.</p>
