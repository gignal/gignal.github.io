<li><p>NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</p>
<p>Gignal respects the copyright of others, and we ask our users to do the same.
Gignal may, in appropriate circumstances and at its discretion, disable and/or
terminate the access of users who may be repeat infringers. If you believe that
your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,
please provide Gignal&#39;s Copyright Agent the following information: an
electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of
the owner of the copyright; a description of the copyrighted work that you
claim has been infringed; a description of where the material that you claim is
infringing is located on the site; your address, telephone number, and email
address; a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed
use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; a
statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in
your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to
act on the copyright owner&#39;s behalf.</p>
</li>
<li><p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Entire Agreement. The TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and
Gignal and governs your use of the Gignal Service, superseding any prior
agreements between you and Gignal with respect to the Gignal Service. Choice of
Law and Forum. The TOS and the relationship between you and Gignal shall be
governed by the laws of Denmark without regard to its conflict of law
provisions. Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of Gignal to exercise
or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of
such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#39; intentions as reflected in
the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and
effect.</p>
